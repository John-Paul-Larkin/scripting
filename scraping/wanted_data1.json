She was due in court the next day for her parental rights case and was to be awarded custody of her children, but due to conflicting court documents it is unclear if she showed up. Ida had left her husband in March 1958 and was hospitalized soon after for various illnesses. As a result, her estranged husband placed their children in a boarding home and moved to Chicago while Ida was in the hospital. The state of Michigan took custody of the children and Ida had been fighting to get them back since she was released. Arrangements had been made for Ida and her children to fly to Florida to visit family after the September 19, 1958, court date but she did not show. Prior to her disappearance, Ida remained in constant contact with her family via mail. Anyone with information regarding Ida\u2019s disappearance is asked to contact the Ann Arbor Police Department.</p>",

The male had a right shoulder surgical implantation of two large staples into the lateral aspect of greater tubercle of the right humerus and a 32 mm (1 \u00bc\u201d) screw into the anterior border of glenoid fossa of the right scapula. He was missing 10 teeth to include his two upper front teeth and there was evidence of a healed nasal fracture. The cause of death could not be determined; however, based on how the body was found this case is considered a homicide. The Michigan State Police (MSP) Violent Crimes Unit (VCU) is requesting assistance with identifying this male and any similar cases.</p>",

The two had been at this location, which was extremely dark, for a short time, waiting for a friend, before falling asleep in the vehicle. Their seats were reclined and the vehicle was off. Both had recently left from a bar and had been drinking that night. While asleep in the car, the victim was awoken to a knock on the driver door window. The subject at the window identified himself as a police officer and began questioning the two about a possible DUI. The suspect requested the victim\u2019s license, registration and insurance. The victim was directed out of the vehicle and brought to the rear of her car. The victim was further questioned and \"frisked\" on the inside of her legs and breasts. The suspect told the victim that because the keys were in the ignition, she could face a DUI charge. The victim questioned the suspect as to his name and badge number but was told to stop asking or she would be handcuffed and arrested. The suspect directed the victim to come with him to his patrol vehicle to submit to a portable breath test. The suspect walked the victim to a nearby alley where he pushed her against a telephone pole. The suspect first digitally penetrated the victim and then sexually assaulted (penile) her. The victim cried out, which her friend heard, and then the friend called out for her and the suspect ran off. The suspect fled from the assault area on foot.</p>",

After driving through the crowd, he exited the vehicle and fired upon local law enforcement. Law enforcement returned fire, and Jabbar was pronounced deceased at the scene.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Surveillance footage from 2:03 a.m. CST shows Jabbar as he walked along Dauphine Street near Governor Nicholls Street. The footage shows Jabbar dressed in a light brown long coat, a dark-colored button-down shirt, blue jeans and what appears to be brown dress shoes. The FBI is also releasing a photo of one of the coolers containing an IED, which was placed by Jabbar near the intersection of Bourbon and Orleans Street.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>The FBI has set up a Digital Media Tipline. Anyone with information, photos, and/or video footage of the incident, Jabbar, or the two coolers containing IEDs should submit them to <a data-urltype=\"/view\" data-val=\"https://tips.fbi.gov/digitalmedia/d31d0368f0b6453\" href=\"https://tips.fbi.gov/digitalmedia/d31d0368f0b6453\" data-linktype=\"external\">www.fbi.gov/bourbonstreetattack</a>.\u00a0</p>",
